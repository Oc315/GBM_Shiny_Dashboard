# GBM Shiny Dashboard

This interactive dashboard explores differential gene expression in Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) under hypoxia and normoxia. It compares different in vitro models across three xenolines.

## 🌐 Live App
👉 [View the dashboard on shinyapps.io](https://oceanus.shinyapps.io/gbm_shiny/)

## 📁 Files
- `GBM_DEMO.Rmd`: Main flexdashboard source file
- `GBM_normalized.csv`: Gene expression data
- `equivtest2comp.r`: Helper script for equivalence testing

## 🔍 Features
- Joint scatter plot with density view for hypoxia vs. normoxia
- Volcano plot with adjustable threshold sliders
- Hover tooltips, filtering, and interactive insights

## 📌 Real-World Impact
This tool supports glioblastoma researchers in evaluating model reliability and hypoxia-driven gene changes, improving treatment planning and biological insight.
